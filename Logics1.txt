Task 1

Logics for EXACT duplicate invoice is:
1. Similar "Invoice Reference Number on Physical Invoice" (XBLNR), "Invoice Document Date" (BLDAT), "Vendor Code" (LIFNR) and "Invoice Amount" (DMBTR).

Justification:
1. Finding duplicate invoice is to avoid same invoice being included in company expenses twice.
2. Although "Line Item" (BUZEI) and "Accounting Document Number" (BELNR) is the unique key for the record, there were duplicate still some records with the same BUZEI and BELNR.
3. Adding XBLNR to BUZEI and BELNR as unique identifier returns no records. However this might be misleading if there were whitespaces around XBLNR, BUZEI and BELNR.
4. Hence the most direct way would be checking duplicate invoice via "Invoice Reference Number on Physical Invoice" (XBLNR), "Invoice Document Date" (BLDAT), "Vendor Code" (LIFNR) and "Invoice Amount" (DMBTR).
    - Each invoice from a single vendor should not have the same reference number, date and amount.
